 * This algorithm was originally developed by Brett Hayes in:
 * The Laboratory for Cosmological Data Mining
 * Professor Robert J. Brunner
 * http://lcdm.astro.illinois.edu/
 * University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne

 * Work continued through the
 * Passionate on Parallel Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
 * Orginal code was developed for shared memory machines
 * During the REU, Alex and Joy converted the code to work with distributed
 * memory using MPI.
